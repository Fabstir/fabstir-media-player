# Web3 Media Player

Work-in-progress (not complete) dapp Web3 media player to play video and music NFTs ERC-721 whose media content is stored in S5. Uses MetaMask Snaps to hold the key portion of the CID in MetaMask wallet's sandboxed local storage whilst the rest of the CID (the portion without the key) is in the NFT's metadata publicly stored in S5, where the CID to this unencrypted metadata is stored on the blockchain. In order to get access to play the NFT's media, a user would need to unlock their MetaMask wallet first. Once that is done, the media player dapp can then use the wallet's Web3 API to access the key of the NFT's content. Combining this with the NFT's metadata that has the CID without the key, gives the full CID to the content stored on S5 that the dapp can now play. The gallery displays NFTs as tiles where their images are loaded lazily using Next.js `<image>` tag.
